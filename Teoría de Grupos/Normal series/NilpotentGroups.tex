\begin{defi}
    A group $G$ is said to be nilpotent if $Z_m(G)=G$ for some $m$. The smallest $m$ such that $Z_m(G)=G$ is called the class of nilpotency of $G$.
\end{defi}
\begin{teo}
    A group of order $p^n$ ($p$ prime) is nilpotent
\end{teo}
\begin{teo}
    A group $G$ is nilpotent if and only if $G$ has a normal series 
    \begin{equation*}
        \{e\}=G_0 \subset G_1\subset \cdots \subset G_m=G
    \end{equation*}
    such that $G_i/G_i-1\subset Z(G/G_{i-1})$ for all $i=1,...,m$.
\end{teo}
\begin{coro}
    Every nilpotent group is solvable.
\end{coro}
\begin{teo}
    Let $G$ be a nilpotent group. Then every subgroup of $G$ and every homomorphic image of $G$ are nilpotent.
\end{teo}
\begin{teo}
    Let $H_1,...,H_n$ be a family of nilpotent groups. Then $H_1\times\cdots\times H_n$ is also nilpotent.
