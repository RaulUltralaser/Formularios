\begin{defi}
    A group $G$ is said to be solvable if $G^{k}=\{e\}$ for some positive integer.
\end{defi}
\begin{teo}
    Let $G$ be a group. If $G$ is solvable, then every subgroup of $G$ and every homomorphic image of $G$ are solvable. Conversely, if $N$ is normal subgroup of $G$ such that $N$ and $G/N$ are solvable, then $G$ is solvable. 
\end{teo}
\begin{teo}
    A group $G$ is solvable if and only if $G$ has a normal series with abelian factors. Further, a finite group is solvable if and only if its composition factors are cyclic groups of prime order.
