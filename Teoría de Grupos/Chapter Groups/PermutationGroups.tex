\begin{defi}
Let $X$ be a nonempty set. The group of all permutations of $X$ under composition of mappings is called the symmetric group on $X$ and is denoted by $S_x$. A subgroup of $S_x$ is called a permutation group on $X$.
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}
    Let $\sigma\in S_n$. If there exist a list of distinct integers $x_1,...,x_n\in n$, such that,
    \begin{align*}
        &\sigma(x_i)=x_{i+1}, \hspace{1cm} i=1,...,r-1,\\
        &\sigma(x_r)=x_1,\\
        &\sigma(x)=x\hspace{1cm}if\hspace{.1cm}x\notin\{x_1,...,x_r\},
    \end{align*}
    then $\sigma$ is called a cycle of length $r$ and denoted by $(x_1,...,x_r$. A cycle of length $2$ is called a transposition.
\end{defi}
\begin{teo}[\textbf{Cayley}]
    Every group is isomorphic to a permutation group.
\end{teo}
\begin{defi}
    The group of symmetries of a regular polygon $P_n$ of $n$ sides is called the dihedral group of degree $n$ and denoted by $D_n$
\end{defi}
\begin{teo}
    The dihedral group $D_n$ is a group of order $2n$ generated by two elements $\sigma,\tau$ satisfying $\sigma^n=e=\tau^2$ and $\tau\sigma=\sigma^{n-1}\tau$, where
    \begin{equation*}
        \sigma=(1\hspace{.1cm}2\hspace{.1cm}...\hspace{.1cm}n),\hspace{.4cm}\tau=\begin{pmatrix}1&2&\cdots&n\\1&n&\cdots&2\end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    Geometrically, $\sigma$ is a rotation of the regular polygon $P_n$ through an angle $2\pi/n$ in its own plane, and $\tau$ is a reflection (or a turning over) in the diameter through the vertex $1$.
\end{teo}
\begin{defi}
    The dihedral group $D_4$ is called the octic group.
