\begin{teo}
Every cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z$ or to $\mathbb Z/(n)$ for some $n\in \mathbb N$
\end{teo}
\begin{teo}
    Any two cyclic groups of the same order (finite or infinite) are isomorphic.
\end{teo} 
\begin{teo}
    Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
\end{teo}
\begin{teo}
    Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group of order n, and let $d$ be a positive divisor of $n$. Then $G$ has exactly one subgroup of order $d$.
