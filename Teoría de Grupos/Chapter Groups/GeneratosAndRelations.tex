\begin{defi}
    Let $G$ be a group generated by a subset $X$ of $G$. A set of equations $(r_j=1)_{j\in A}$ that suffice to construct the multiplication table of $G$ is called a set of defining relations for the group ($r_j$ are products of elements of $X$).

    The set $X$ is called a set of generators. The system $(X;(r_j=1)_{j\in A})$ is called a presentation of the group.
