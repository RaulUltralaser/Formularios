Recall that an automorphism of a group $G$ is an isomorphism of $G$ onto $G$. The set of all automorphism of $G$ is denoted by $Aut(G)$. We have seen that every $g\in G$ determines an automorphism $I_g$ of $G$ (called an inner automorphism) given by $x\mapsto gxg^{-1}$. The set of all inner automorphism of $G$ is denoted by $In(G)$.

    The set $Aut(G)$ of all automorphism of a group $G$ is a group under composition of mappings, and $In(G)\vartriangleleft Aut(G)$. Moreover, 
    \begin{equation*}
        G/Z(G)\simeq In(G)
    \end{equation*}
