\begin{teo}
    Any permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ is a product of pairwise disjoint cycles. This cyclic factorization is unique except for the order in which the cycles are written and the inclusion or omission of cycles of length 1.
\end{teo}
\begin{coro}
    Every permutation can ve expressed as a product of transpositions.
\end{coro}
\begin{teo}
    IF $\alpha, \sigma \in S_n$ then $\tau =\alpha\sigma \alpha^{-1}$ is the permutation obtained by applying $\alpha$ to the symbols in $\sigma$. Hence, any two conjugate permutations in $S_n$ have the same cycle structure.
    
    Conversely, any two permutations in $S_n$ with the same cycle structure are conjugate.
\end{teo}
\begin{coro}
    There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of conjugate of $S_n$ and the set of partitions of $n$.
\end{coro}
